# munchmonch - DevTest Branch

## Introduction
Welcome to the DevTest branch of munchmonch! This branch is dedicated to ongoing development and testing of new features and improvements for the munchmonch food ordering system. Please note that the code in this branch may not be stable or fully functional, as it is a work-in-progress. It is recommended to use the main branch for a stable and tested version of munchmonch.

## Purpose
The DevTest branch is used for concurrent development and testing of new features before they are merged into the main branch. This branch allows the team to work on multiple features simultaneously without impacting the stability of the main branch. It serves as an isolated environment for experimenting, debugging, and refining new functionalities. However, please be aware that the code in this branch may contain bugs or incomplete features, so it is not recommended for production use.

## Contributions
Contributions to the DevTest branch are closed due to assignment restrictments as of now. If you would like to contribute to the ongoing development and testing efforts, or wish to improve the existing code, kindly email me (pengsies@gmail.com) first!
